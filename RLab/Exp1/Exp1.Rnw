\section{Measure of central tendency}
\subsection{Ungrouped data}
Problem: \newline
Twenty students, graduates and undergraduates, were enrolled in
a statistics course. Their ages were
18,19,19,19,19,20,20,20,20,20,21,21,21,21,22,23,24,27,30,36.
a) Find Mean and Median of all students
b) Find median age of all students under 25 years.
c) Find modal age of all students

\subsection{Grouped data}
Problem:
A survey of 25 faculty members is taken in a college to study their
vocational mobility.They were asked the question â€œIn addition to your present
position,at how many educational instistutes have served on the
faculty?.Following is the frequency distribution of their responses. Find mean and median of the distribution

\section{Measure of dispersion}

An entomologist studying morphological variation in species of mosquito
recorded the following data on body length:
1.2,1.4,1.3,1.6,1.0,1.5,1.7,1.1,1.2,1.3.
Compute all the measures of dispersion.
