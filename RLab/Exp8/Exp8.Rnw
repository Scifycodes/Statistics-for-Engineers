\section{t-test}
The t.test( ) function produces a variety of t-tests. Unlike most statistical packages, the
default assumes unequal variance.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  one sample t-test: t.test(y,mu=mean value)
  \item independent 2-group t-test: t.test(y~x) where y is numeric and x is a binary factor
  \item independent 2-group t-test: t.test(y1,y2)  where y1 and y2 are numeric
  \item paired t-test: t.test(y1,y2,paired=TRUE)  where y1 and y2 are numeric
\end{itemize}
\emph{An outbreak of salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice produced at a certain
factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled batches
ice crean.The levels(in MPN/g) were:
0.593, 0.142, 0.329, 0.691, 0.231, 0.793, 0.519, 0.392, 0.418. Is there evidence that the mean level pf Salmonella in ice cream greater than 0.3
MPN/g?}
<<>>=
x <- c(0.593,0.142,0.329,0.691,0.231,0.793,0.519,0.392,0.418)
t.test(x, alternative = "greater", mu=0.3)
@
From the output we see that the p-value = 0.029. Hence, there is moderately
strong evidence that the mean Salmonella level in the ice cream is above 0.3
MPN/g.

\emph{Suppose that 10 volunteers have taken an intelligence test; here are the
results obtained. The average score of the entire population is 75 in the same test. Is
there any significant difference (with a significance level of 95\%) between the sample
and population means, assuming that the variance of the population is not known.
Scores: 65, 78, 88, 55, 48, 95, 66, 57, 79, 81}
<<>>=
scr <- c(65, 78, 88, 55, 48, 95, 66, 57, 79, 81)
t.test(scr, mu=75)
qt(0.975, 9)
@
The t-computed value is smaller than t-tabulated, we accept the null
hypothesis of equality of the averages.\\
Alternatively we could consider the p-value with a significance level of
95\%. If p-value is greater than 0.05 then we accept the null hypothesis
H0, otherwise we reject the null .

\\
\emph{Comparing two independent sample means, taken from two populations
with unknown variance.The following data shows the heights of individuals of two
different countries with unknown population variances. Is there any significant
difference b/n the average heights of two groups.\\
A: 175 168 168 190 156 181 182 175 174 179\\
B: 185 169 173 173 188 186 175 174 179 180\\}
<<>>=
a <-c(175, 168, 168, 190, 156, 181, 182, 175, 174, 179)
b <- c(185, 169, 173, 173, 188, 186, 175, 174, 179, 180)
t.test(a, b, var.equal = FALSE, paired=FALSE)
qt(0.975, 10.224)
@
The p-value $>$ 0.05, we conclude that the means of the two groups are
significantly similar.\\
The value of t is less than the tabulated t-value for 10.224 df, we accept H0.
\emph{Suppose the recovery time for patients taking a new drug is measured (in
days). A placebo group is also used to avoid the placebo effect. The data are as
follows\\
with drug : 15 10 13 7 9 8 21 9 14 8\\
placebo : 15 14 12 8 14 7 16 10 15 2\\
Is there any significant difference between the average effect of these two drugs?}
<<>>=
wd <- c(15, 10, 13, 7, 9, 8, 21, 9, 14, 8)
plc <- c(15, 14, 12, 8, 14, 7, 16, 10, 15, 2)
t.test(wd, plc,alternative="less",  var.equal=TRUE )
@
P value(0.5199) $>$ 0.05 then there is no evidence to reject our Null hypothesis.

\emph{Five Measurements of the output of two units have given the following results (in kilograms of material per one hour of operation) .Assume that both samples have been obtained from normal populations, test at 10\% significance level if two populations have the same variance

\section*{Practice Problem}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A certain stimulus administered to each of the 13 patients resulted in the following increase of
blood pressure: 5, 2, 8,-1, 3, 0, -2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6, 8. Can it be concluded that the stimulus, in
general, be accompanied by an increase in the blood pressure?
\item The manufacturer of a certain make of electric bulbs claims that his bulbs have a
mean life of 25 months with a standard deviation of 5 months. Random samples of 6
such bulbs have the following values: Life of bulbs in months: 24, 20, 30, 20, 20, and
18. Can you regard the producerâ€™s claim to valid at 1\% level of significance?
\item Data on weight (grams) of two treatments of NMU ( nistroso- methyl urea) are
recorded. Find out whether these two treatments have identical effects by using t test
for sample means at 5\% level of significance.\\
